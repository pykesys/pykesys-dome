------------------------
what is the expected quotient of aluminum, titanium, iron, silica, and more from asteriod regolith

------------------------
The expected material yield from **asteroid regolith** varies significantly depending on the **type of asteroid** — mainly **S-type**, **C-type**, and **M-type**. For dome construction and industrial processing, the most valuable targets are usually **S-type (stony)** asteroids due to their high content of silicates, metals, and oxides.

Here’s a breakdown of **typical yields** (by weight %) for the key materials you’d likely extract per 100 metric tons of raw regolith from an **S-type asteroid**:

---

### 🔍 **Material Yield Estimates (per 100 tons regolith)**

| Element / Compound | % by Weight | Mass (kg) | Primary Use |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Silica (SiO₂)**  | 20–25%      | 20,000–25,000 | Glass, insulation, ceramics |
| **Iron (Fe)**       | 15–20%      | 15,000–20,000 | Structural supports, alloys |
| **Nickel (Ni)**     | 1–2%        | 1,000–2,000   | Alloying, batteries |
| **Aluminum (as Al₂O₃)** | 10–12% | 10,000–12,000 | ALON, ceramics |
| **Magnesium (MgO)** | 5–8%       | 5,000–8,000   | Alloying, ceramics, glass flux |
| **Calcium (CaO)**   | 3–5%        | 3,000–5,000   | Glass flux, construction blocks |
| **Sodium (Na₂O)**   | 1–3%        | 1,000–3,000   | Glass production, chemical processing |
| **Titanium (TiO₂)** | 2–5%        | 2,000–5,000   | Structural alloys, reflective coatings |
| **Chromium / Manganese / Others** | ~0.5–1% | ~500–1,000 | Specialized alloying, sensors |
| **Slag & Inert Debris** | 20–25% | 20,000–25,000 | Fill, bricks, radiation shielding |

### 🪨 **Asteroid Type Comparison (Generalized)**

| Asteroid Type | Rich In | Poor In | Notes |
|---------------|---------|---------|-------|
| **S-type**    | Fe, Ni, SiO₂, Al₂O₃ | Organics, volatiles | Great for structural + dome materials |
| **C-type**    | Volatiles, carbon, water ice | Metals | Good for water + nitrogen sourcing |
| **M-type**    | Fe, Ni, Co | Silicates, volatiles | Ideal for bulk metal processing |

---

### ⚙️ Processing Implications

- **ALON Production:** Requires high-purity Al₂O₃ and AlN, both extractable and synthesizable from S-type or hybrid regolith + volatiles from C-type
- **Dome Glass:** Readily produced from SiO₂, MgO, CaO, Na₂O — abundant in S-types
- **Titanium:** Extracted as ilmenite (FeTiO₃) or anatase/rutile (TiO₂); reduction can be done with H₂ or CO
- **Iron:** Easily magnetically separated and smelted
