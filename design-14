The mining and transport architecture is now fully expanded to include:

Four scalable T-class transport ship sizes

Stackable SPoC containers

A 100-year growth model with production, recycling, and colonization ratios

Manufacturing projections and resource allocation over time

Would you like this visualized next as:

A fleet evolution timeline,

A cutaway illustration of the modular T-class ships, or

A circular SPoC docking and transport animation?

We can make this supply chain not just function — but flow. 🌒🛰️📦
