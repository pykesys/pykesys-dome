## Lunar Orbit Smelting Dock Design (SPoC-Integrated)

### Objective:
Define the layout and function of a **moon-orbit-based smelting dock** designed to receive incoming SPoCs (Self-Propelled Ore Containers), offload ore in microgravity, and process raw regolith into refined materials including ALON precursors, titanium, iron, glass, and supporting alloys or silicates, for dome and infrastructure construction.

### I. Dock Overview

**Location:** Lunar equatorial orbit at ~100 km altitude

**Structure:**
- Modular toroidal station with radial processing spokes
- Rotation-capable sections for simulated microgravity during processing stages
- SPoC docking array ringed on outer hull with centralized feed tunnels

**Capacity:**
- Handles up to 400 SPoCs per rotation cycle
- Continuous 24/7 processing capability with full automation

---

### II. SPoC Docking and Ore Intake

**Docking Ring:**
- SPoCs arrive under autonomous control
- Each docks into a square interface port leading to a cylindrical intake tube

**Automated Door Interface:**
- SPoC door retracts laterally (like a panel slide)
- Ore is extracted using a low-thrust gravity motivator system (electromagnetic and pneumatic pulses)
- Ore flows into pressurized intake locks and onto a conveyor system

---

### III. Ore Conveyor System

**Design:**
- Magnetized, segmented conveyor belts in vacuum-tight tubing
- Micro-paddles push ore segments in rhythmic motion

**Functions:**
- Transfers ore from intake locks to crusher array
- Built-in scanners detect ore type, moisture, and contamination

---

### IV. Crushing and Sorting Bay

**Components:**
- Rotary crusher rings for initial fragmentation
- Micropulverizers for fine-grain ore separation
- Electrostatic and magnetic sorters to isolate:
  - Alumina-rich silicates (for ALON, glass)
  - Iron-rich oxides (for structural alloy)
  - Titanium-bearing minerals (e.g., ilmenite)
  - Calcium, magnesium, sodium (for fluxes, glass, or ceramics)

**Output Channels:**
- Ore fractions sorted and channeled to specialized smelters or glass kilns

---

### V. Specialized Refining Chambers

#### 1. **ALON Material Stream (Alumina & Aluminum Nitride)**
- Extracted Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ is purified via thermal electrolysis
- AlN synthesized by reacting refined aluminum with recovered N‚ÇÇ gas (from NH‚ÇÉ cracking)
- Both components sent to ALON sintering module for pellet or sheet formation

#### 2. **Titanium Stream**
- Ilmenite (FeTiO‚ÇÉ) reduced using hydrogen or carbon monoxide in a high-temperature reactor
- Yields titanium sponge and iron as byproduct
- Titanium sponge processed under vacuum into bars or powder for alloying

#### 3. **Iron Stream**
- Magnetic separation and thermal smelting of iron oxides
- Cast into ingots, structural bars, or frame beams
- Used in titanium alloys or habitat supports

#### 4. **Glass Stream**
- Silica-rich tailings from alumina refining routed to solar glass kilns
- Mixed with CaO, MgO, and Na‚ÇÇO extracted from regolith
- Molded into dome panels, lenses, or internal optics

#### 5. **Alloy and Ceramic Components**
- Minor elements (e.g., vanadium, manganese, zircon) extracted for custom alloys
- Used in precision components, electromagnets, and composite materials

---

### VI. Slag & Byproduct Handling

**Slag Compaction Unit:**
- Residual silicates, non-useful oxides, or glassy waste
- Molded into tiles, bricks, or shielding panels for reuse

**Secondary Uses:**
- Radiation shielding
- Bulk structural fill
- Ceramic precursors

---

### VII. Output Logistics

**Finished Goods Bays:**
- Autonomous packaging into crates/modules
- Staged for launch via tether-based orbital launchers or lunar drop-pods
- Sorted for dome construction (glass, ALON, Ti alloy) and infrastructure (steel, ceramics, bulk fill)

**Return of Empty SPoCs:**
- Cleaned and inspected at dock
- Refilled with compressed air and navigation data
- Loaded into outbound T-class carrier or deployed independently to new mining mission

---

### VIII. Control & Automation

- AI-operated command center with redundancy
- Onboard monitoring: Thermal, electromagnetic, and mechanical sensors
- Fault-tolerant systems with nanobot repair units for micro-damage

---

### IX. Resource Allocation Summary (Per 100 Tons Ore Input)
| Material | Typical Yield (kg) | Final Use |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ    | 12,000             | ALON, glass ceramics |
| AlN      | 6,000 (from Al + N‚ÇÇ) | ALON formation |
| Ti       | 4,500              | Alloy beams, supports |
| Fe       | 20,000             | Frames, tools, girders |
| Glass (SiO‚ÇÇ blend) | 25,000 | Panels, lenses, insulation |
| Flux metals (Ca, Na, Mg) | 8,000 | Glass, chemical processes |
| Slag      | 24,500             | Bricks, radiation shielding |

This refined, multi-material process converts raw ore into a full spectrum of construction-grade materials necessary for solar system colonization, while maximizing recycling and reducing waste. It transforms the orbital dock into the forge of the Solar Bloom civilization.
