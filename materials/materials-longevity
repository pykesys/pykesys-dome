Perfect! Let's do a **side-by-side longevity and degradation analysis** of four materials—**stainless steel, titanium, bronze, and ceramics**—all placed in the same controlled environment:

---

## 🏞️ **Environmental Assumptions**
- **Location:** Deep, dry cave  
- **Relative Humidity:** <30%  
- **Temperature:** Stable, ~50–60°F (10–15°C)  
- **Air Composition:** Low oxygen exchange, neutral pH, minimal salts or acids  
- **Disturbance:** None (buried or sheltered from contact and weathering)

---

## 🔬 Comparative Longevity & Degradation Table

| **Material**        | **Degradation Mechanism** | **Approx. Corrosion Rate** | **Time to 25–30% Loss** | **Long-Term Behavior** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Stainless Steel (304/316)** | Surface oxidation (rust), crevice/pitting | ~0.0003 mm/year | **~3,000–4,000 years** | Slowly embrittles, loses strength, may fracture |
| **Titanium (Grade 2)**        | None in dry air; rare stress corrosion | ~0.00001 mm/year | **100,000–300,000 years** | Chemically stable; self-passivating; may last longer than any metal |
| **Bronze (88% copper, 12% tin)** | Oxidation (patina), slow pitting | ~0.0001–0.0005 mm/year | **5,000–10,000 years** | Forms protective patina; corrodes gracefully; artifacts survive millennia |
| **Ceramic (clay, fired at high temp)** | Microfractures, thermal stress, erosion | None (non-reactive) | **Indefinite** (brittle failure) | Will not corrode; but fragile under stress or impact |
